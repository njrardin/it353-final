                        The first time I decided I first wanted to learn to program I did what many people do and Googled "how to program". 
                        I received hundreds of results, understood none of them, and promptly decided it was too hard and I'd come back
                        to it later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second time I decided I wanted to learn to program, I clicked the top result,
                        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy</a> and after 2 hours of learning how to add numbers and print things to
                        a mysterious place called the "command prompt" I once again decided it was too hard and I'd just come back to it later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that I've been programming for a few years, I've realized that the problem wasn't that programming was too hard, 
                        it was that I didn't know how to learn it. I could find thousands of resources online to "learn programming", but I
                        couldn't find a single one that explained what programming was, what can be done with it, how to find the right
                        learning tools for my goals, and how to use those tools to learn. Chances are, if you're reading this, you're in the
                        same boat I was in. You want to learn to program, but you don't know where to start. You've probably tried a few
                        times, but you've never gotten very far. You've probably even tried to learn a language, but you
                        realized quickly that you don't know why you're learning it, or what you're going to do with it once you've learned it.
                        <em>The goal of this website isn't to teach you how to program, it's to teach you how to learn to program.</em>

                        The roadmap for learning programming that I've found to be the most effective is simply to find a project you want to
                        build, and then learn the skills you need to build it. This is the most effective way to learn because it gives you
                        a clear goal to work towards, and it gives you a reason to learn the skills you need to build it. One thing to keep in
                        mind is that nearly all the skills you learn this way are transferrable even to projects that use entirely
                        different technologies. So the most important thing is to just start somewhere, and if you find that you don't like
                        the technology you're using, you can always switch to something else later. Eventually you'll find something you like,
                        and with all the skills you've learned along the way, you'll be able to build it.

                        That said, here's the roadmap I recommend for learning programming:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>Decide on a project</p></li>
                        <li><p>Discover relevant technologies</p></li>
                        <li><p>Pick a tutorial</p></li>
                        <li><p>Start building</p></li>
                        <li><p>When you get stuck, ask for help</p></li>
                        <li><p>Repeat</p></li>
                    </ol>
